## Building Realm for nodejs-mobile on Android

This is a repo to experiment with building Realm for [nodejs-mobile](https://github.com/JaneaSystems/nodejs-mobile) on Android. [nodejs-mobile-react-native](https://github.com/JaneaSystems/nodejs-mobile-react-native) supports building native modules for Android/iOS but only with node-gyp. Realm uses Cmake-JS as its build tool, so it needs different configuration.
